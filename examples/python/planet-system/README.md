# Planet System

Animated planetary system demo using ovrtx Python bindings. Demonstrates loading a USD scene and injecting additional geometry via `add_usd_layer`, using `bind_attribute`/`map_attribute` for zero-copy transform updates, and GPU-accelerated animation with Warp kernels. Planets orbit a central cube with hierarchical animation (orbit parent rotation + planet self-spin).

By default, rendered frames are streamed to [rerun.io](https://rerun.io/) for live visualization. Frames can also be saved to disk as PNGs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10–3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Running

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--gpu` | Device on which to copy animated transforms <cpu\|gpu> Default: cpu |
| `--num-planets N` | Number of planets, 1–1000 (default: 36) |
| `--png` | Save rendered frames as PNGs to `_output/` |
| `--no-rr` | Disable rerun.io streaming |
| `--log` | Enable carb log file in `_output/` |

The first time the example is run, driver shader compilation will be performed and cached. Subsequent runs will be much faster.
