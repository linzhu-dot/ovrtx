C: Minimal Example
==================

This example shows basic initialization of the renderer, rendering a single frame from an RGB camera, mapping the output and writing the result to disk as a PNG.

The example loads an example scene from S3 and writes the resulting image to ``out.png``.

The first time you run the example, the driver compiles and caches shaders. Subsequent runs are much faster.

.. image:: ../../img/out.jpg
   :alt: Minimal example output
   :align: center

Build and Run
-------------

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      **Prerequisites**

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo apt install build-essential cmake

      The ovrtx library is downloaded automatically at configure time. If ovrtx is already installed and available via ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, the local installation is used instead.

      **Building**

      .. code-block:: bash

         cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
         cmake --build build

      **Running**

      .. code-block:: bash

         ./build/minimal

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      **Prerequisites**

      - `Visual Studio 2017+ <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_

      The ovrtx library is downloaded automatically at configure time. If ovrtx is already installed and available via ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, the local installation is used instead.

      **Building**

      .. code-block:: pwsh

         cmake -B build
         cmake --build build --config Release

      **Running**

      .. code-block:: pwsh

         .\build\Release\minimal
