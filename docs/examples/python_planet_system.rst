Python: Planet System
=====================

Animated planetary system demo using ovrtx Python bindings. Demonstrates loading a USD scene and injecting additional geometry via ``add_usd_layer``, using ``bind_attribute``/``map_attribute`` for zero-copy transform updates, and GPU-accelerated animation with Warp kernels. Planets orbit a central cube with hierarchical animation (orbit parent rotation + planet self-spin).

By default, rendered frames are streamed to `rerun.io <https://rerun.io/>`_ for live visualization. Frames can also be saved to disk as PNGs.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 3.10–3.13
- `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_

Running
-------

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run main.py

Options
^^^^^^^

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Flag
     - Description
   * - ``--gpu``
     - Device on which to copy animated transforms <cpu|gpu> Default: cpu
   * - ``--num-planets N``
     - Number of planets, 1–1000 (default: 36)
   * - ``--png``
     - Save rendered frames as PNGs to ``_output/``
   * - ``--no-rr``
     - Disable rerun.io streaming
   * - ``--log``
     - Enable carb log file in ``_output/``

The first time you run the example, the driver compiles and caches shaders. Subsequent runs are much faster.
